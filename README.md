# Predicting Credit Card Balance using Regression

One of the projects I built when I was learning about regression :) 

Written in Python. I uploaded the dataset I used but you can also find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/ishaanv/ISLR-Auto#Credit.csv 

The Notebook has quite a comprehensive explanation of the code, but please read the Project Presentation!
